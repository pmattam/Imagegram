Photo Gallery Web Page

Created a basic photo gallery web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

The main feature to implement: When a user clicks a thumbnail image, make that image show up as the main image.

    . dynamically created the thumbnails from an array of image URLs
    . highlights the current thumbnail that has been clicked (using a border or by adding a transform:scale)
    . added arrow buttons on either side of the main image to go to the next and previous images.
