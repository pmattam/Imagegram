Photo Gallery Web Page

Create a basic photo gallery web page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

The main feature to implement: When a user clicks a thumbnail image, make that image show up as the main image.

    . dynamically create the thumbnails from an array of image URLs
    . highlight the current thumbnail that has been clicked (using a border or by adding a transform:scale)
